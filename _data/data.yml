      - role: Research Assistant(with Prof. Lee Cooper)
        time: Sep 2023 - Present
        Location: Northwestern University
        details: |
            -Utilize Multi-Instance learning techniques in digital pathology for prostate cancer molecular subtype classification, potentially improving accuracy and robustness of the model's predictions.
            -Introduce supervised End-to-end model for the tile-level features to improve the performance of the MIL model in the PAM50 dataset.
            -Investigate the impact of pre-trained foundational models to the performance when combined with MIL for molecular subtype classification.
            -Incorporate multi-scale representations of digital path imaging data to enhance the model’s ability to predict molecular subtypes in PAM50 dataset.
            -Drafted a paper including an in-depth comparison of the proposed method with current state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness through detailed ablation studies.
            -Implement attention gates and residual connections within the U-Net architecture to better capture intricate tumor boundaries and improve segmentation accuracy, especially for small or complex regions.
            -Implement weakly supervised methods for analyzing pathology images to predict two-year survival of patients diagnosed with brain tumors.

      - role: Research Assistant(with Prof. Bernard Martin)
        time: Jun 2022 - Sep 2022
        Location: University of Michigan
        details: |
            -Assisted in collecting data and determining performance within constrained movement environments.
            -Developed a Matlab program to process and analyze EMG signals and filter the noise of EMG data.
            -Designed and implemented a rehabilitation remote game for stroke patients with adaptable difficulty and real-time evaluation..
            -Designed and constructed low-cost low fidelity adjustable mock-ups for human subject studies.
            -Preliminary data presented at the CDHW Symposium in October 2022.

      - role: Research Assistant(with Prof. Nanning Zheng and Xuetao Zhang)
        time: Jun 2021 - Jun 2022
        Location: Xi’an Jaotong University
        details: |
            -Implemented Graph-based Clustering and k-means++ with a pre-generated anchor graph on Matlab.
            -Collected and interpreted data, compared against the baseline algorithm in different data sets, and applied regression testing.
            -Tested the effectiveness of L2 and L1 norms and verified that L21 norms outperformed other norms.
            -Implemented KNN and PCA algorithms in Python and designed the lab procedure.
            -Co-published reports on "Robust Landmark Graph-based Clustering for High-Dimensional Data".
