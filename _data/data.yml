            - Utilize Multi-Instance learning techniques in digital pathology for prostate cancer molecular subtype classification, potentially improving accuracy and robustness of the model's predictions.
            - Introduce supervised End-to-end model for the tile-level features to improve the performance of the MIL model in the PAM50 dataset.
            - Investigate the impact of pre-trained foundational models to the performance when combined with MIL for molecular subtype classification.
            - Incorporate multi-scale representations of digital path imaging data to enhance the model’s ability to predict molecular subtypes in PAM50 dataset.
            - Drafted a paper including an in-depth comparison of the proposed method with current state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness through detailed ablation studies.
            - Implement attention gates and residual connections within the U-Net architecture to better capture intricate tumor boundaries and improve segmentation accuracy, especially for small or complex regions.
            - Implement weakly supervised methods for analyzing pathology images to predict two-year survival of patients diagnosed with brain tumors.
